<h1>JavaScript Scope Exercise</h1>
<ol>
    <li> Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
		<pre> 
			x = 1;
			var a = 5;
			var b = 10;
			var c = function(a, b, c) {
				var x = 10;
				document.write(x);
				document.write(a);
				var f = function(a, b, c) {
					b = a;
					document.write(b);
					b = c;
					var x = 5;
				}
				f(a,b,c);
				document.write(b);
 			}
			c(8,9,10);
			document.write(b);
			document.write(x);
        </pre>
        <p>The output is: 10889101</p>
    </li>
    <li>What is the difference between a method and function?
        
        <p>A function is a group of statements dedicated to perform a certain task. A function in JavaScript is an object. A method, on the other hand, is a function that belongs to a javascript object.</p>

    </li>
    <li>What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?
    	<p> this keword is used in Java to refer to the object that called the method. </p>
    </li>
    <li> What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?
        <p>
        this keyword is used in JavaScript to refer to the object calling the method(the owner object). 

        </p>
    </li>
    <li> What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?
        <p>
        this keyword is used in JavaScript to refer to the owner object. 

        </p>
    </li>
    <li> Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'.
When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?
        <p>
        this keyword is used in JavaScript to refer to the owner object in this case Object x.

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>What is a free variable in JavaScript?
        <p>
        A free variable is a variable used within a function, which is neither a formal parameter to the function nor defined in the function's body (and in scope at the point of the variable's use).
        </p>
    </li>
<li>Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.
        <pre>
        var o = {
        			name : "fred",
        			major : "music",
        			f : function(a, b){
        					return (a>b || a&lt;b)?Math.min(a,b):a*b;
        				}
    			};

        </pre>
    </li>
<li>Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function. Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.
        <pre>
        function Employee(name, salary, position){
        	this.name = name;
        	this.salary = salary;
        	this.position = position;
    	}
    	var emp1 = new Employee('Mk', 100000, 'SE');
    	var emp2 = new Employee('HG', 100000, 'SD');
    	var emp3 = new Employee('BB', 100000, 'FD');
        </pre>
    </li>
<li>Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the arguments.
        <p>
	        function product(){
	        	var total = 1;
	        	for(let i=0;i&lt;arguments.length;i++){
	        		total *= arguments[i];
	        	}	
	        	return total;
	    	}
	    	var p1 = product(1,25,6,10);
	    	var p2 = product(4,20,5,10);
        </p>
    </li>
<li>Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.
        <p>
        var maximum = (a,b,c) => Math.max(3,9,2);
        </p>
    </li>

</ol>
