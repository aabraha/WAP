<h1>JavaScript Exercises</h1>
<ol>
    <li> What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
        <pre>
            setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
            setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);
        </pre>
        <p> The first setTimeout makes the booyah function to be called after 2000 seconds while the second setTimeOut statement is calling the booyah in that expression.
            without any delay of time</p>
    </li>
    <li>What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
        <pre>
            var myfunc = function(a, x) {
             return a * x;
           };
           var x = myfunc(2, 3);
           var y = myfunc;
           alert(x);
           alert(y(2,3));
        </pre>
        <p>Both alert statements display 6.</p>

    </li>
    <li>Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that
says “BOOYAH!”
<pre>
setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);
</pre>
        <pre>
           function booyah1(){
                alert("BOOYAH!");
           }
     
           function booyah2(){
                setTimeout(booyah3,2000);
           }
           function booyah3(){
           		alert("BOOYAH!");
       		}
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li> What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
for using it)?
        <p>
        Unobstusive JavaScript is JavaScript that doesn't mix up CSS or HTML into JavaScript. The advantage of having Unobstrusive JavaScript is separation of markup, stylesheet and scripts.
